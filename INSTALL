- Generate documentation
Assuming that Doxygen is installed on your system, to generate documentation
for the source code, the only thing you need to do is (from the source dir):

	$ doxygen

 And then, a Doc directory will appear, containing all the documentation


- Pre-compiled x64 ElfHunter
 As you can see, a x64 precompiled version of ElfHunter binary has been
 shipped with the code. Using it or re-compile it from the source is your
 choise. Nothing change


- Compiling from source code:
 The makefile is included in the source code distribution. So, all you need
 to do is

	$ make all


- Compiling faster:
 If you have a multi-processor/multi-core processor, you should use:

	$ make -jn

 Where 'n' is the number of processing units.
 Example:

	$ make -j4



- Installation
 After compiling, the ElfHunter binary should be available. If you wish to
 install it, you can (from the source code directory):

	# cp ./ElfHunter /usr/local/bin/

 (You can change /usr/local/bin as you prefer)
 
 ATTENTION:
 You will notice that icons are missing...So, it's better (until i'll provide
 an installation script or something like that) to NOT "install" ElfHunter in
 some "system" directory. Use it somewhere in your home directory
